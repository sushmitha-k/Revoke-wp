							<h2>Coffee, Spice & More</h2>
							<p>Fondly referred to as the ‘Coffee Cup of India’, this is one sobriquet that Coorg wears with an almost possessive air. After all, some of the world’s best coffee is grown here, and the slopes are redolent with the aroma of fine Arabicas and Robustas.

This heartland of Indian coffee is renowned for its ‘monsoon-fed coffee’, shade-grown under giant Rose Wood, Wild Fig and Jack Fruit trees. While nurturing and instilling the beans with exotic flavours and aromas, these fruit laden trees are a unique eco-system by themselves providing home to thousands of birds and animals including the Great Indian Pied Hornbill and the Giant Malabar Squirrel.

Come February, the air is filled with the heavy fragrance of snow white coffee blossoms, heralding the onset of the coffee season. In November, the plants are dotted with ripe red coffee cherries. And throughout the year, it is the beverage of choice for natives and tourists alike.</p>

								<h2>Culture</h2>
								<p>The Kodavas have a distinct ethnic identity they have zealously safeguarded over the centuries. They have their own unique language, customs and traditions.

The names of Kodava people are characteristic and include a clan name. The clan is central to Kodava culture and families trace their lineage through clans. Marriage within a clan is discouraged.

Kodavas have many cultural differences from the other communities in southern India. Though they are Hindu, Kodavas do not accept Brahmin priests, preferring that ceremonies are conducted by their own elders. The elders of the community help in organising the ceremonies. The importance of the fire god found in most of the Hindu rituals is usually absent in Kodava culture. Usage of slokas and vedic chants is also not present.

Easily one of the most martial cultures in the country, these are a people who ritually worship their guns and swords. Interestingly, till a few decades ago, the birth of a male child was marked with a gun shot, announcing to the world the arrival of a warrior. And when the child was named, he was fed the preserved meat of the tiger, in the belief that he would one day grow up to fight like one.</p>

											<h2>A Photographer’s Guide to Coorg</h2>
											<p class="tm-box-p">When you think of Coorg, you’ll invariably think of lush green meadows, waterfalls, temples, monuments, and culture. There’s something for everyone. This means as a photographer you have a variety of choices in front of you.
So, here’s a Coorg guide from a photographer’s perspective that might help you immensely in planning your trip around photography. Except for the waterfalls shot, you can take similar or even better photographs with any camera. So, don’t restrict yourself because of your camera, just unleash your imagination. Let’s dive right in.Raja’s Seat
One of the most visited sites in Coorg is Raja’s seat. It’s usually bustling with tourists because of the panoramic view of the rolling mountains which Coorg is famous for. This place is famous for sunset.
Photo Tips:While early morning will yield some misty feel, the evening can yield best results. You can plan to visit both these times as it’s in the Madikeri town. Instead of shooting only the panoramic view, try including the Raja’s tomb to set the context and people to give a sense of scale and emotion as seen in the below photo. The drizzle during the monsoon gave it a mystical feel, which is the best time to visit the Coorg if you truly want to witness the magic.</p>
